## About

The Austin Digital Twin is an extraordinary project aimed at redefining urban management and public safety through technology. This repository contains the code for generating a digital twin of Austin, Texas, using publicly available real-time information. The project is an interactive, real-time 3D map of Austin's dynamic cityscape, offering immediate insights into critical aspects such as fires, police activity, and live traffic data. This initiative is developed in collaboration with the [University of Texas Urban Information Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/uil/), the City of Austin, and the TeXuS Lab.
